                    <p>We implement a comprehensive range of technical and organizational measures designed to protect your
                        personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These
                        measures include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encryption: We use SSL/TLS encryption to protect the transmission of data to and from our
                            Platform. This ensures that any data transmitted is secure and cannot be easily intercepted by
                            unauthorized parties.</li>
                        <li>Access Controls: We restrict access to personal information to authorized personnel only. Access
                            to sensitive information is granted on a need-to-know basis and is protected by multi-factor
                            authentication where possible.</li>
                        <li>Data Anonymization: Where feasible, we anonymize data to reduce the risk of exposure in the
                            event of a data breach. Anonymized data cannot be traced back to an individual without
                            additional information.</li>
                        <li>Secure Storage: Personal information is stored in secure environments protected by firewalls,
                            intrusion detection systems, and other advanced security technologies.</li>
                        <li>Regular Security Audits: We conduct regular security assessments and audits to identify and
                            address vulnerabilities in our systems. This includes both internal audits and external
                            penetration testing.</li>
                        <li>Employee Training: Our employees receive regular training on data protection and privacy
                            practices to ensure they understand the importance of safeguarding personal information and are
                            equipped to implement our security measures effectively.</li>
                        <li>Incident Response Plan: We have an incident response plan in place to address potential data
                            breaches or security incidents promptly. This plan includes steps for containing the breach,
                            assessing its impact, notifying affected users, and preventing future incidents.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Limitations and No Guarantee of Absolute Security</h3>
                    <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, it is
                        important to understand that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is
                        completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Users
                        are encouraged to take additional precautions to protect their information, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating Strong Passwords: Use complex passwords that include a combination of letters, numbers,
                            and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information, such as birthdates or common
                            words.</li>
                        <li>Keeping Passwords Confidential: Do not share your passwords with others and avoid writing them
                            down where they can be easily found. Consider using a password manager to keep track of your
                            passwords securely.</li>
                        <li>Monitoring Account Activity: Regularly check your account for any unauthorized activity and
                            report any suspicious behavior to us immediately.</li>
                        <li>Updating Software: Keep your software, including your operating system and browser, up to date
                            to protect against security vulnerabilities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You acknowledge and accept that any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. In the
                        unlikely event of a data breach, we will promptly notify you and take all necessary steps to
                        mitigate any potential harm. Your trust and the security of your data are of utmost importance to
                        us, and we are committed to continuously improving our security practices to protect your
                        information.</p>

                    <h2>7. Retention of Data</h2>
                    <h3>How Long Data is Kept</h3>
                    <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which
                        it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting,
                        or reporting requirements. Once the retention period has expired, we will securely delete or
                        anonymize your personal information, ensuring that it cannot be reconstructed or read.</p>
                    <h3>Criteria for Data Retention</h3>
                    <p>The specific duration for which we retain your personal information depends on various factors,
                        including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nature of the Information: Different types of personal information may be retained for different
                            periods depending on their sensitivity and the purpose for which they were collected. For
                            example, account information may be retained for as long as your account is active, whereas
                            non-personally identifiable information may be retained for a shorter period.</li>
                        <li>Legal Obligations: We may be required to retain certain information for specific periods to
                            comply with legal and regulatory obligations. This includes records related to financial
                            transactions, legal disputes, and investigations.</li>
                        <li>Business Needs: Information necessary for the operation and improvement of our Platform and
                            services may be retained for longer periods. This includes data used for analytics, research,
                            and business planning.</li>
                        <li>User Requests: We honor requests for the deletion or anonymization of personal information in
                            accordance with applicable laws. However, we may retain certain information to comply with legal
                            obligations or for legitimate business purposes, even after a deletion request has been
                            fulfilled.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Data Retention Practices</h3>
                    <p>To ensure that your personal information is retained only for as long as necessary, we implement the
                        following practices:</p>
                    <ul>

                            whether it is still necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Data that is no
                            longer needed is securely deleted or anonymized.</li>
                        <li>Data Minimization: We aim to collect and retain only the minimum amount of personal information
                            necessary to achieve the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                        <li>Secure Disposal: When personal information is no longer needed, we ensure that it is securely
                            deleted or destroyed using industry-standard methods to prevent unauthorized access or use.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You have the right to request access to your personal information and to request its correction or

                        <li>When we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require it
                            for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
                        <li>When you have objected to processing pending the verification of whether our legitimate grounds

                        particular situation, where the processing is based on our legitimate interests. If you object, we
                        will cease processing your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for
                        the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment,
